On the left, is my pet, Tiger. He is approximately 1.5 years old. He is one of my greastest stress releivers, he used to be a pretty wild thing, but, 
he has calmed down extremely. The photo taken of him here is one of my favorites. 
You are able to see truly how unique his coat is, and the sharpness of his eyes. They almost are piercing when you look at them.

  <h4>6/20/2023: AvenueE</h4>
<p id = "aboutMeSection">
Below, is one of my answers to a prompt for the AvenueE program at UCD.

<br>
 <br>
"I would like to participate in the AvenueE program for the mere fact that I feel I would be able to expand my network in the realm of Software Engineering. Last year, I built a connection with an alumni of Davis/AvenueE. Her name is Abigaela Boroica. Me and Abigaela had a variety of conversations relating to the industry, and she even offered me a referral to her company (Oracle) when I graduate from Davis. The aspect of my encounters with Abigaela that stood out to me was that I got a glimpse of how she described the AvenueE program. She described AvenueE to be close-knit, and full of opportunities. She immediately told me to apply to AvenueE and get involved as much as I can. AvenueE was an essential component to launching her into her career. With her enthusiasm about the program. It not only encouraged me to apply, but it also encouraged me to be invested and involved in the Davis community. Although I am a transfer, and my time here will be shorter than other students. I still will be able to contribute heavily with my own personal experiences."
