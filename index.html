                  I am an incoming transfer to UC Davis in the Fall of 2023. I am majoring in CSE (Computer Science & Engineering). Some hobbies of mine include delving in technically sound projects to learn new technologies. I am currently learning the Bootstrap framework for CSS, along with Node.js and Express.js. Some hobbies of mine include running, watching Marvel movies, and also reading books. As an Afghan-American, I find it extremely important to assist underrepresented communities in the field of technology. One of my goals is to start a club at UC Davis that primarily focuses on connecting fellow Afghan Engineers.

                I started programming in 2021 when I took my first course in programming, and I developed an interest for the problem-solving aspect of it. I recently started picking up a bit of front-end web development and this practice portfolio is to showcase for that. I am not the biggest fan of front-end development. I have a feeling I may be more of a fan of the backend side of things. I like algorithmic thinking when it comes to solving my bugs in code, unfortunately I despise divs.
